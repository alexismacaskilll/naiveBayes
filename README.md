# Naive Bayes

This project implements a Naive Bayes classifier for classifying emails as either spam or ham (= nonspam). This classifier uses one of the most popular and simple machine learning classification algorithms, the Naive Bayes algorithm. The Naive Bayes algorithm is based on the Bayes Theorem for calculating probabilities and conditional probabilities.
